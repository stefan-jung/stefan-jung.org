    chart.js is used to render the terminology statistics.
    
    The Oxygen Webhelp plugin is using require.js for asynchronous loading of JavaScript libraries.
    The main benefit is, that the page is loaded and rendered while the JavaScript libraries are loaded.
    The "normal way" is, that all CSS/JS libraries are loaded BEFORE the HTML content is rendered.
    This slows down the rendering of the website.
    
    require.js can load only AMD modules, so be sure to require one of the UMD builds.
    In order to use the time scale, you need to make sure one of the available date adapters and 
    corresponding date library are fully loaded after requiring chart.js.
