**Head of Technical Documentation at Dometic**

I am leading a global technical documentation team in a prestigious international company. I am a passionate technical writer with more than 15 years of working experience. Further on, I am a software developer with a strong focus on XML and web technologies. I built OSS tools for DITA on [github.com/stefan-jung](https://github.com/stefan-jung) using [oXygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/). My tools help people to create DITA content in a convient way.
